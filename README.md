# gotta-catch-em-all

## Project Description
- Have you ever wanted to learn some basic facts about your favorite pokemon or any pokemon for that matter? This is where "Pokemon Search" comes in... Simply enter a pokemon's name and click the "Search" button. You will then be presented with some cool facts about that pokemon like their height, weight, abilities, and type. Plus a cool image of what that pokemon looks like. If you wish to search for another pokemon simply just rinse and repeat! You can search by either Name or Pokemon ID #
