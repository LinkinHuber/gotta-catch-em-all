## Project Description
- Have you ever wanted to learn some basic facts about your favorite pokemon or any pokemon for that matter? This is where "Pokemon Search" comes in... Simply enter a pokemon's name or ID and press "enter" or click the "Search" button. You can also search without entering a name which brings up a random pokemon. You will then be presented with some cool facts about that pokemon like their name, height, weight, abilities, and type. Plus a cool image of what that pokemon looks like. If you wish to search for another pokemon simply just rinse and repeat!
